# Medicare-claims-vision-Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze [Medicare claims data](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Medicare-Claims-Vision-and-Eye-Health-Surveillance/vyr8-ynqe/about_data) related to vision and eye health surveillance, focusing on demographics, medical diagnoses, and healthcare service utilization. The dataset includes information on beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS) from 2014 to 2019. Our objective is to uncover patterns and trends that can inform healthcare providers and policymakers about vision health trends and outcomes among the Medicare population.

## Business Case
Understanding the prevalence of vision health conditions and service utilization among the Medicare population is crucial for improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. By analyzing this data, we can identify areas for operational improvement, enhance patient care strategies, and optimize resource allocation. Insights gained can help reduce the burden of eye diseases, improve access to care, and support the development of targeted interventions.
